\arguments{
\item{X}{A nxm matrix with n observations and m variables.}

\item{xy}{x- and y-axis values: a vector of length 2 with either the column name(s) of the X matrix to plot (character) or the index position(s).}

\item{design}{A nxk "free encoded" experimental design data frame.}

\item{color}{If not \code{NULL}, a character string giving the column name of \code{design} to be used as color.}

\item{shape}{If not \code{NULL}, a character string giving the column name of \code{design} to be used as shape.}

\item{points_labs}{If not \code{NULL}, a character vector with point labels.}

\item{title}{Plot title.}

\item{xlab}{If not \code{NULL}, label for the x-axis.}

\item{ylab}{If not \code{NULL}, label for the y-axis.}

\item{size}{The points size.}

\item{size_lab}{The size of points labels.}

\item{drawShapes}{Multiple shapes can be drawn based on the \code{color}: "none" for non shape (default), "ellipse" (ellipses with ggplot2::stat_ellipse), "polygon" (polygons with ggplot2::geom_polygon) or "segment" (segment from the centroids with ggplot2::geom_segment).}

\item{theme}{ggplot theme, see \code{?ggtheme} for more info.}

\item{typeEl}{The type of ellipse, either \code{norm} (multivariate normal distribution), \code{t} (multivariate t-distribution) or \code{euclid} (draws a circle with the radius equal to level, representing the euclidean distance from the center).}

\item{levelEl}{The confidence level at which to draw an ellipse.}

\item{alphaPoly}{The degree of transparency for polygons.}
