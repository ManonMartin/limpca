Description: >
 This package has for objectives to provide a method to make Linear Models 
 for high-dimensional designed data. limpca applies a GLM (General Linear Model) 
 version of ASCA and APCA to analyse multivariate sample profiles generated 
 by an experimental design. ASCA/APCA provide powerful visualization 
 tools for multivariate structures in the space of each effect of 
 the statistical model linked to the experimental design and contrarily 
 to MANOVA, it can deal with mutlivariate datasets having more variables 
 than observations. This method can handle unbalanced design.
